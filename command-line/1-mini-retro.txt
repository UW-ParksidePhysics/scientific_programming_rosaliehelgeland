What Went Well
It wasn't as difficult as I thought that it would be! 


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
I think my focus could be improved
* Focus: 6/10

* Communication: 6/10

* Pacing: 5/10, it was a little fast! I struggled to listen and type at the same time.. I made a typo and got confused so I redid the assignment a different day.

* Division of responsibility 10/10

* Code quality: 8/10
